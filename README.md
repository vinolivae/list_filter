## Problem
given a list with **["1", "3", "6", "43", "bike", "6", "abc"]** return how many odd numbers there are filtering a list.
## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `list_filter` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:list_filter, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
